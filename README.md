# Hadden
- Upload post form fields:
- Description (textarea)
- Tags (Copy the tag handler from the upload form)
- Also add Images, Videos, and Audios as separate select menus but don't worry about the options yet

Once your done with the form, work on the post page and style the component UserPost.svelte to look like the Figma.
For the time being you can omit the journal section


- Create view/images?videos?audios routes


# ToDo
- Add journal entries route
- Fix bug where the my-files load action happens when you click on the hamburger menu
- Create filters for searching
- Create about page

- Change profile page to contain post and file data rather then views
- Add user followers system


# Long term ToDo
- Integrate an LLM that can switch contexts based on the searched user
