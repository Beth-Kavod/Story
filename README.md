Upload post form fields:
Date
Title 
Description (textarea)
Privacy (Select menu with options: Public, Private, Unlisted)
Tags (Copy the tag handler from the upload form)
Also add Images, Videos, and Audios as separate select menus but don't worry about the options yet

Once your done with the form, work on the post page and style the component UserPost.svelte to look like the Figma.
For the time being you can omit the journal section




# ToDo

- Fix bug where the my-files load action happens when you click on the hamburger menu
- Create filters for searching
- Create views API page
